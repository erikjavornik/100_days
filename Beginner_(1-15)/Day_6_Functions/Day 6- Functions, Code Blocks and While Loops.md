# Notes
Functions: Predefined code that performs a specific task. Ex. print(), len(), etc. Can make own functions starting with “def”. Unless function is called in main body of code, the function will not execute. Makes code more readable and easier to understand

``` python
def my_function(inputs if needed)

Do this

Then do this

Finally do this
```
Calling Functions: `my_function(input)`

Indentation: Can use the tab key or four spaces

While Loop: While loops can create an infinite loop. If this happens, printing the condition may show the reason the loop never terminates. The for loop goes through a list or range. The while loop will repeat as long as the condition is true 

``` python
while something_is_true:
```
