# Goal:
 Create a program that will play hangman
# Step 1. Creating Flow Chart
![[Pasted image 20230613085025.png]]

# Step 2. Starting from Flow Chart Beginning
``` python
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.
import random

chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)

#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.
for letter in chosen_word:
  if guess == letter:
    print("Correct")
  else:
    print("Wrong")
```
# Step 3. Replacing Blanks with Guesses
``` python
import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)

#Testing code to help debug
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.

guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

display = []
for letter in chosen_word:
  display.append("_")

#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].
list_index = 0

for letter in chosen_word:
    if letter == guess:
        display[list_index] = guess
            
    list_index += 1
#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.
print(display)
```
# Step 4. Check if the Player has Won
``` python
import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#Create blanks
display = []
for letter in chosen_word:
  display.append("_")

#TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.

while "_" in display:
  guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

#Check guessed letter
  list_index = 0

  for letter in chosen_word:
      print(f"Current position: {list_index}\n Current letter: {letter}\n Guessed letter: {guess}")
      if letter == guess:
          display[list_index] = guess
      list_index += 1
  print(display)

print("You win")
